##Simulting Quantum Infinite Square Well and Quantum Harmonic Oscilltor

1. We will start off with our knowledge of the solutions (energy eigen-states) of the quantum systems and obtain a visualization of the time-evolution of the probability density.

2. Next, we will look into a method to represent the Hamiltonian of the system in form of a square matrix (matrix representation of the Hamiltonian operator) and use the matrix representation to numerically obtain energy eigen-states and eigen-values of the system. The results of the computation can be verified with our knowledge about the solution of the systems

3. Once, the eigen-states are obtained, one way to obtain the time-evolution is Part-1. In this part, we will look into an alternative method of time-evolution. For the Infinite Square Well, and the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, this time-evolution succession must match that in Part-1.
